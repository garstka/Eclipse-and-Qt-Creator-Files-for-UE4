# Eclipse-and-Qt-Creator-Files-for-UE4

This is a quick one-off script for generating the files to evaluate Eclipse CDT and QT Creator 5 as an alternative to
Visual Studio 2019 for Unreal Engine 4 development on Windows.

Requires Python 3.

## How to use this

1. Drop in the same directory as sln and uproject.

2. Double click or execute from the command line to generate:

- Source/EclipsePathsAndSymbols.xml
- Source/{project_name}.pro
- Source/includes.pri
- Source/defines.pri

3. Set up your projects:

- Qt: Bits and pieces
  from [this tutorial](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/tool-tut-win-unreal-qt-creator-project-generator-v0-3/21391)
  work, a few menus were moved around since then.

- Eclipse:

  a) Install Eclipse CDT

  b) [Set up Cygwin](https://www.eclipse.org/4diac/documentation/html/installation/cygwin.html)

  c) Create a Makefile Project with Existing Code (Cygwin GCC, Language: C++), pick your source directory.

  d) Properties -> C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols -> GNU C++ -> Import

## Evaluation results

These are my experiences as of June 2021. I looked at responsiveness and navigation capabilities.Tested on an i7-10875H
/ 32GB of memory / SSD.

I purposefully ignore paid solutions here. I did not look at completion and refactoring capabilities.

TLDR: I wasn't able to get either Eclipse, or Qt Creator to work properly in the time I set aside for this.

### Visual Studio

In my experience:

- It keeps reindexing all the time.
- It's slow to navigate and find usages (slow=multiple seconds).

```
IntelliSense operation in progress...
```

### Qt Creator

Similar experience to Visual Studio:

- Reindexes from the beginning when opening a project.
- After it's done indexing, it still isn't fully functional,
  (e.g. when opening a new project file, it's grayed out for multiple seconds)

Promising features:

- It builds an index of some kind up front in a finite amount of time.
- Seems more lightweight than Visual Studio 2019.

### Eclipse CDT

The way Eclipse CDT works, it wouldn't reindex needlessly once the index was built. In my experience, it has vastly
superior navigation capabilities UX-wise to Visual Studio
(instant Navigate, Find Usages, Call Hierarchy), though these require the index to be built properly (see below)

I was unsuccessful in getting it to work:

#### It lacks the scalability to index the entire engine code

a) The indexer is slow and hard to debug

  ```
  [1,623,383,665,339] Parsed GroupedSpriteSceneProxy.cpp: 4533 ms - parse failure. Ambiguity resolution: 1940 ms
  ```

b) The indexer is single-threaded, see [Bug 351659](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=351659)

c) If the entire engine code is included, it errors out on memory very early (~1-3% indexed, tested up to 16GB heap
space)

  ```
  java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
  ```

To test this scenario, add engine code (Properties -> C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols -> Source Location: Engine
folder, e.g.

  ```
  C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.26\Engine
  ```

#### It has trouble with the widespread use of macros in engine code

a) Codan seems to ignore variadic macros like UCLASS sometimes reporting

```
Syntax error: [X] could not be resolved
```

despite "Go To Definition" working. Similar to [this](https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1086391/), but the
resolution doesn't work. It will report this error in one file, but not another file next to it.

I used a workaround to define these variadic macros at the project level.

b) It cannot handle generated code macros like GENERATED_BODY, it seems to confuse them across translation units.

I don't see an easy workaround, since the generated methods are very common.
